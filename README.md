# GDSC CU DSA Challenges

Hi there, we at the GDSC Core Team are trying out a new thing -- weekly data structure & algorithm challenges to get us to up our game.

There'll be a new challenge every Monday by noon, and we'll discuss our solutions during the Friday meeting. 

Got any questions, comments or feedback? Text me [@omgitsalongusername](https://t.me/omgitsalongusername) on Telegram.

Ready? Head over to [Week 1](week-one.md).
